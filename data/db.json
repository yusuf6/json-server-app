      "body": "Seeing as your grand opening is an important part of your marketing strategy, a good amount of thought should go into the type of party/event you want this to be. Do you want it to a casual, family-friendly affair? Are you going for a more upscale/formal feel? Is a more professional atmosphere appropriate? The type of event you throw should have a good flow with the overall feel of your business. For example, you might not want to do a pizza party or barbeque if you are opening an upscale hotel or boutique. On the other hand, a black-tie event is going to seem odd for the grand opening of a toy store. When choosing what you want for your grand opening, be it a red-carpet event, a small ceremony, an open house, or a family-oriented community event, consider what will get your target audience in the door and keep them there.",
